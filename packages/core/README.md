# @time-fit/core

TimeFit's ESM decision engine for time-based JITAIs. Define decision points, provide storage
ports and plugins, then call `tick()` from your scheduler. Node 20+ required. TimeFit is not yet
published to npm; until first release, clone this repository, run `yarn install`, and try
`examples/quickstart` or `yarn example1`.

After release:
```sh
npm install @time-fit/core
```

## Minimal example

This is the runnable [`examples/quickstart`](../../examples/quickstart/index.mjs):

```js
import { createTimeEngine } from "@time-fit/core";
import { createMemoryStore } from "@time-fit/core/memory";

const store = createMemoryStore({ participants: [{ id: "ada", timeZone: "America/Detroit" }] });
const printReminder = {
  type: "print-reminder",
  execute: async ({ message }, { participant, scheduledAt }) => {
    console.log(`[${scheduledAt.toISOString()}] to ${participant.id}: ${message}`);
    return { ok: true, delivery: { channel: "console" } };
  },
};
const engine = createTimeEngine({
  storage: store,
  actions: [printReminder],
  tasks: [{
    id: "stretch-break", scope: "participant",
    checkpoints: [{ id: "mid-morning", time: "10:30", daysOfWeek: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] }],
    outcomes: [
      { id: "remind", probability: 0.5, action: { type: "print-reminder", message: "Time to stretch!" } },
      { id: "control", probability: 0.5, action: null },
    ],
  }],
});
await engine.tick(new Date("2026-09-22T14:30:00Z"));
```

## Core concepts

A task has a participant or `system` scope, ordered checkpoints, optional eligibility, an
optional precondition tree, and outcomes. Participant tasks use each participant's IANA time
zone; system tasks declare their own `timeZone`. Checkpoints are `cron`, fixed `time`, or a
preference resolved by your app. Eligibility selects the population and produces no record for
an excluded participant. Availability is the precondition tree; eligible unavailable decisions
are recorded unless `logUnavailable: false`.

Preconditions compose `{ all: [...] }`, `{ any: [...] }`, `{ not: ... }`, and
`{ condition: { type, ...params } }`. Outcomes have probabilities summing to one; `action: null`
is an explicit control arm. TimeFit derives a reproducible randomized arm and creates a decision
record containing its identity, task version, scheduling/availability, allocation, and delivery
or failure result. See [task-spec ADR](../../docs/adr/0006-task-spec.md) and
[decision-record ADR](../../docs/adr/0004-decision-record-identity-delivery.md).

## Ports and plugins

Supply `storage` with `participants.iterate({ cursor, limit })`, either static `tasks` or
`tasks.listActive(at)`, and `decisionLog.claim/complete/fail` (optional `recordGap`). You may
override any of those ports directly. Optional ports are `clock`, `random`, `logger`,
`preferenceResolver`, and `snapshot`. The [ports ADR](../../docs/adr/0002-ports.md) defines
the exact contract; `@time-fit/core/memory` is for tests, demos, and short-lived reminders—not
research data.

Register immutable plugin objects. A Condition has `type`, optional `validate(params)`, and
`async evaluate(params, ctx)` returning `{ ok: true, met, evidence? }` or `{ ok: false, error }`.
An Action similarly exposes `async execute(params, ctx)` and returns `{ ok: true, delivery? }` or
`{ ok: false, error }`. `ctx` includes `decisionId`, task/checkpoint IDs, `scheduledAt`, zone,
participant, correlated logger, and `AbortSignal`. See [plugin ADR](../../docs/adr/0003-plugin-contract.md).

## Running and options

`await engine.tick(now)` is primary: use it from cron, serverless, or tests. `engine.start()` is
only an in-process minute timer; call `await engine.stop()` to stop it. A process never overlaps
its own ticks, while atomic decision-log claims protect overlapping ticks and separate processes.

Defaults: `catchUpWindowMinutes: 5`, `concurrency: 1`, `pageSize: 100`, and
`pluginTimeoutMs: 30_000`. Start I/O-bound deployment tuning near concurrency 8, measure it, and
keep `pageSize` at least four times concurrency to avoid underfilled page waves. Concurrency is
1–64; it preserves order within each participant, not across participants. See the
[performance benchmark](../../docs/stage-f-review/README.md), [calendar ADR](../../docs/adr/0005-calendar-and-scheduling.md), and [engine clarifications](../../docs/adr/0009-stage-c2-engine-clarifications.md).

Read [delivery guarantees](../../docs/guides/delivery-guarantees.md) and
[privacy guidance](../../docs/guides/privacy.md) before a study deployment. Generated `.d.ts`
files in each package tarball are the API reference.
